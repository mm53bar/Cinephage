### Changed

- **Docker base image changed from Alpine to Debian** - Required for Camoufox browser support. Existing users should pull the new image and recreate containers. See [Migration Notes](#migration-notes) below.
- **Unified Tasks page** - Consolidated monitoring settings into Settings > Tasks (removed separate Monitoring page)
- **CutoffUnmet task** - Now specifically targets items below quality cutoff (daily frequency)
- **Upgrade task** - Now searches ALL items for potential upgrades, not just below cutoff (weekly frequency)
- **Standardized library/discover routes** - Library moved to `/library/movies` and `/library/tv`, discover details to `/discover/movie/:id` and `/discover/tv/:id`, with legacy redirects from old paths
- **Subtitle search on import** - Automatically triggers subtitle search when movies/episodes are imported to library
- **Library deletion UX** - Immediate status updates on file/media deletion without page refresh, auto-redirect to library lists after removal
- **Mobile UI responsiveness** - Activity table mobile card view, live TV channel search in modal, improved responsive layouts across all pages
- **Series monitoring locked state** - Disabled season/episode monitoring toggles when parent series is unmonitored, with visual lock indicators and status banners
- **Subtitle task activity** - MissingSubtitles and SubtitleUpgrade tasks now record detailed per-item history
- RequestBuilder now recognizes `name` and `search` as valid search parameters (for UNIT3D trackers)
- Migrated from native TypeScript indexers to YAML-only definitions
- Rebuilt indexer database schema with definitions table and enhanced status tracking
- Enhanced health tracking with consecutive failure counting and exponential backoff
- Added protocol-specific settings columns for torrent/usenet/streaming
- RequestBuilder filters unsupported search parameters based on live indexer capabilities
- HLS proxy properly marks streams as VOD with `#EXT-X-PLAYLIST-TYPE:VOD` and `#EXT-X-ENDLIST`
- HLS proxy handles obfuscated segment URLs (providers using fake extensions like .txt, .jpg)
- Videasy streaming provider uses parallel extraction across 4 servers simultaneously
- Exclude specials (season 0) from series episode counts
- Added database indexes and TMDB response caching for performance
- Language-aware streaming with parallel extraction optimization

### Removed

- **Browser Solver** - Replaced by new Captcha Solver using Camoufox (more reliable, better anti-detection)
- **BROWSER*SOLVER*\* environment variables** - Captcha Solver is now configured via the UI
- **Monitoring settings page** - Consolidated into unified Tasks page
- **Duplicate task registry** - Removed registry.ts in favor of UnifiedTaskRegistry
- Native TypeScript indexer implementations (replaced by YAML definitions)
- Old indexer registry and base classes
- **Podnapisi subtitle provider** - Server no longer responding
- **Subscene subtitle provider** - Blocked by CloudFlare protection

### Fixed

- **Monitoring history typo** - Fixed `grabbeRelease` → `grabbedRelease` in task history recording
- **Svelte state warnings** - Fixed TaskCard and IntervalEditor components capturing initial prop values
- **Language profile assignment** - Fixed default language profile not being assigned when adding media with subtitles enabled (query pattern issue)
- **Subf2m subtitle provider** - Updated CSS selectors to match current site structure
- **Docker entrypoint syntax** - Fixed shell script syntax error in docker-entrypoint.sh
- **Docker USER directive** - Removed conflicting USER directive for proper entrypoint privilege dropping
- **Activity table links** - Fixed paths from `/movies/{id}` to `/library/movie/{id}` and `/tv/{id}` to `/library/tv/{id}`
- **Queue client filter** - Fixed queue and history client filtering behavior on mobile
- **Series monitor icon** - Fixed series header icon to update instantly on monitor toggle without page refresh
- **NPM memory leak prevention** - Added `.npmrc` settings and Docker memory limits to prevent build failures
- HLS streams starting from end instead of beginning (missing VOD markers)
- HLS segment detection for providers using obfuscated URLs with fake extensions

### Migration Notes

#### Volume Mount Change (/app/data → /config)

**BREAKING CHANGE:** Docker volume mounts have been consolidated to a single `/config` directory to avoid mounting `/app` and reduce the risk of overwriting application files.

**What changed:**

- Old: `./data:/app/data`
- New: `./config:/config` (single mount for app data, cache, and indexer definitions)

**Automatic migration:**

If you previously used `/app/data` mounts, the entrypoint script will automatically migrate your data when you add the `/config` mount alongside the old mount:

1. Update your `docker-compose.yaml` to add `/config` mount (keep old mounts temporarily):

   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./config:/config # NEW: Add this
     - ./data:/app/data # Keep temporarily
      - /path/to/media:/media # REQUIRED: Your media library
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads # REQUIRED: Download client output folder
   ```

2. Start container - migration happens automatically:

   ```bash
   docker compose up -d
   docker compose logs cinephage | grep -i migrat
   ```

3. After successful migration, remove old mounts:
   ```yaml
   volumes:
     - ./config:/config # Keep only this
     - /path/to/media:/media # REQUIRED: Your media library
     - /path/to/downloads:/downloads # REQUIRED: Download client output folder
   ```

**If migration fails due to permissions:** Run container once as root with `user: 0:0` and set `PUID`/`PGID` environment variables. See [Troubleshooting Guide](docs/support/troubleshooting.md#migration-from-legacy-appdata-and-applogs-mounts).

**Your data is safe:** The migration copies (not moves) your data, so your original files remain untouched until you remove the old mounts.

#### Docker Image Change (Alpine to Debian)

The Docker image has changed from `node:22-alpine` to `node:22-slim` (Debian). This change was required to support the new Camoufox-based Captcha Solver, which needs Firefox browser dependencies that are not available on Alpine Linux.

**What you need to do:**

1. Pull the new image:

   ```bash
   docker compose pull
   ```

2. Recreate your container:
   ```bash
   docker compose up -d --force-recreate
   ```

**What's different:**

- Image size increased by ~40MB (180MB -> 220MB)
- First startup will download the Camoufox browser (~80MB, stored in data volume)
- The `BROWSER_SOLVER_ENABLED` environment variable is no longer used (remove from your `.env`)
- Captcha Solver is now configured via Settings > Integrations > Captcha Solver

**Your data is safe:** The SQLite database, logs, and configuration are stored in the mounted `/config` volume and will not be affected.
