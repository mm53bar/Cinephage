Want to contribute? Here's how to get set up.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20 or higher
- npm 10 or higher
- A running instance of qBittorrent (for download client testing)

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MoldyTaint/cinephage.git

   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install

3. Copy the environment example and configure:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

4. Start the development server:

   ```

## Development Workflow

### Code Style

- We use **Prettier** for code formatting and **ESLint** for linting
- Run `npm run format` before committing to ensure consistent formatting
- Run `npm run lint` to check for linting issues

### Running Tests

```bash
npm run test        # Run all tests
npm run test:watch  # Run tests in watch mode
```

### Type Checking

```bash
npm run check       # Run svelte-check for TypeScript errors
```

### Dependency Audit

```bash
npm run deps:audit  # Run dependency audit (unused/unlisted packages)
```

### Building

```bash
npm run build       # Build for production
```
