## What is Cinephage?

Cinephage unifies your entire media workflow into a single, modern application. Instead of running multiple services that don't talk to each other, you get one cohesive platform that handles everything.

**One database.** All your movies, TV shows, live TV channels, subtitles, and indexer configs live together. No sync issues, no data fragmentation.

**One interface.** Browse, search, monitor, and manage everything from a single, responsive UI built with Svelte 5.

**One configuration.** Set up your indexers, download clients, and preferences once. They work across movies, TV, and streaming.

**One place.** Whether you're downloading a BluRay remux, streaming via .strm files, or watching live TV, it's all in Cinephage.

---

## What It Replaces

Cinephage brings together functionality you'd typically find across multiple applications:

- **Radarr & Sonarr** — Movie and TV series management
- **Prowlarr** — Indexer management with supported trackers
- **Bazarr** — Multi-provider subtitle management
- **Overseerr** — Content discovery and smart lists
- **FlareSolverr** — Built-in Cloudflare bypass (no external service needed)
- **Plus** — Live TV/IPTV management, usenet streaming, and more

The \*arr projects are fantastic at what they do. We just took a different path — one unified codebase instead of separate services that need to sync with each other.

---

## Key Features

### Stream Without Downloading

Create `.strm` files that point to online sources and watch instantly. No disk space, no waiting for downloads, no seeding. Works with Jellyfin, Emby, Kodi, or any player that supports .strm files.

### Built-in Cloudflare Bypass

Camoufox integration handles Cloudflare challenges automatically. No separate FlareSolverr container to maintain, no configuration headaches. It just works.

### Usenet Streaming

Stream directly from NZBs without downloading the entire file first. Unique seekable stream implementation with adaptive prefetching and segment caching.

### Live TV with Portal Discovery

Connect Stalker portals and automatically discover working MAC addresses. Full EPG support, channel management, and HLS streaming.

### Smart Quality Scoring

50+ scoring factors including codec efficiency (x265/AV1), HDR formats, audio quality, and release group reputation. Custom format creation for personalized scoring rules.

### Smart Lists

Dynamic content discovery with auto-add to library. Import from IMDb, Trakt, TMDb lists, or create custom queries. "Automatically add all 2024 movies rated 7.5+" — fully automated.

### Everything Else You'd Expect

- File watching and auto-import
- Multi-indexer search with deduplication
- 6 subtitle providers, 80+ languages
- 7 automated monitoring tasks
- Jellyfin/Emby notifications
- TRaSH Guides-compatible naming

## Quick Start

### Docker (Recommended)

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
services:
  cinephage:
    image: ghcr.io/moldytaint/cinephage:latest
    container_name: cinephage
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - '3000:3000'
    environment:
      - PUID=1000 # Your user ID (run: id -u)
      - PGID=1000 # Your group ID (run: id -g)
      - TZ=UTC
      - ORIGIN=http://localhost:3000 # Trusted app origin / CSRF origin
      - BETTER_AUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 # Auth callback/redirect base URL
    volumes:
      - ./config:/config
      - /path/to/media:/media # CHANGE THIS
      - /path/to/downloads:/downloads # CHANGE THIS
```

Then start it:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

**That's it.** Open http://localhost:3000 and follow the setup wizard.

Tag policy:

- `latest` = current stable release
- `dev` = current preview build
- `vX.Y.Z` = pinned stable release

If you later access Cinephage through a hostname or reverse proxy, update
`BETTER_AUTH_URL` to that public URL. You can also set the External URL in the UI under
`Settings > System`.

> **Note:** Your persistent app data and cache are stored in `./config` (automatically created). Logs are emitted to container stdout/stderr. Never mount `/app` as it contains application code.
>
> **Upgrading from older versions?** See [Migration Guide](docs/support/troubleshooting.md#migration-from-legacy-appdata-mounts) if you previously used `/app/data` mounts.

### Requirements

- **TMDB API Key**: Free at [themoviedb.org/settings/api](https://www.themoviedb.org/settings/api)
- **Download Client** (optional): qBittorrent, SABnzbd, NZBGet, or NZBMount
  - Or use streaming mode — no download client needed
- **Optional**: ffprobe for media info extraction
